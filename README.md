# Data-Aquisition-

Single is a data acquisition application that records the images taken by Andor iXon EMCCD Camera (http://www.andor.com/scientific_cameras/ixon/) as PMA files. The PMA files are analyzed by custom written IDL and MATLAB scripts, to generate smFRET traces and histograms.

Single was written in Visual C++ 6.0 in the beginning, but the revised version documented in this manual was rewritten in Visual C++ .NET 2003. It is a very simple small program, but has been good enough to take a lot of good smFRET data for many years.
